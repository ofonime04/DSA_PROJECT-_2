This is my capstone project for Digital Skillup Africa (DSA) course (July 2025) by incubator hub.

## PROJECT TOPIC: PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The objective of this project is to give an insight that will guide the management of Palmora Group to make informed decision on how to address gender inequality as published by the media. The decision will be guided by results gotten from analyzing the data received from the HR department.
