# DSA_PROJECT_2
This is my capstone project for Digital Skillup Africa (DSA) course (July 2025) by incubator hub.

## PROJECT TOPIC: PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The objective of this project is to give an insight that will guide the management of Palmora Group to make informed decision on how to address gender inequality as published by the media. The decision will be guided by results gotten from analyzing the data received from the HR department. 

#### Data Source
The data source is Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx and Palmoria Group emp-data.csv which contains information from the HR department. The Microsoft excel file contains 1016 columns/6rows personnel data (e.g name, gender, department, salary) and the CSV file contain 6 columns/12 rows bonus rating. 

#### Tools Used
-	Microsoft Power Bi

### METHODOLOGY

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involves the exploring of the data to answer some of the questions like
-	Gender distribution per region 
-	Rating based on gender
-	Salary structure with regards to gender
  
#### Data Analysis
This is where we use the new measure to generate additional columns where required during the analysis. Example 

### RESULTS/FINDINGS

The Palmora Group should issue a media publication to counter the perception published by the media and include the analysis done as evidence.
